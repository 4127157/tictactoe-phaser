Strategy:-
1 - Modern style development using as many libraries and resources to make the
job easy
    a: SocketIO instead of ws

2 - For frontend use some pre baked libraries for React or just standalone

3 - Preferably use Phaser.io game engine and build it on top with SocketIO and
Node for networking

4 - Deploy using Docker Compose

5 - If not Phaser then Canvas is the way to go with custom development over
HTML5
